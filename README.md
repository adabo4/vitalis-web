# VITALIS website

I contributed to the creation of this website by providing design ideas and later applied key features that enhanced its visual appeal. Now, I keep the site updated with the latest news.

## Features

- Slider added using 'react-slick' library. I studied its documentation to make logoslider that fitted my requirements.
- Gallery to showcase leaflet added using 'Lightgallery.js' after reviewing the documentation on how to use the library. 
- Email validation in the form. 
- Google Analytics using React-GA and adding Consent Banner using cookies to remember the users choice of consent. 

## What I learned

- The basics of how react works in order to start adding the features. 
- The concept of useState, useEffect, useRef
- How to use the props that pass the properties from the parent components to children.
- How to use cookies to store the users consent and once its given the Google Analytics (GA) can start tracking events on the website. However, the user must have a choice to remove the consent and once that happens, the GA script has to stop tracking the events. 
- How to add various libraries that help to efficiently speed up the process of web development instead of creating the feature from the scratch.
